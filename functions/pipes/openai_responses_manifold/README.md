# OpenAI Responses Manifold

Integrates OpenAI's Responses API into Open WebUI, enabling features such as built‑in search, reasoning summaries and token caching.

**Version 0.7.0 – Pre‑production preview.** The pipeline is still under early testing and will be fully released as `1.0.0`.

## Installation
1. Copy `openai_responses_manifold.py` to your Open WebUI under **Admin ▸ Pipelines**.
2. Activate the pipe and configure the valves for your environment.

## Features
| Feature | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native function calling | ✅ GA | Toggle via `ENABLE_NATIVE_TOOL_CALLING`. |
| Visible reasoning summaries | ✅ GA | Available for o‑series models only. |
| Encrypted reasoning tokens | ✅ GA | Persists reasoning context across turns. |
| Optimized token caching | ✅ GA | Saves ~50–75 % tokens on tuned models. |
| Web search tool | ✅ GA | Automatically invoked or toggled manually. |
| Image generation | ⚠️ Planned | Coming soon. |
| Image input (vision) | ⚠️ Planned | Slated for a future release. |
| File upload | ⚠️ Planned | Roadmap item. |

### Quality of life improvements
- **Pseudo-models**
  - `o3-mini-high` – alias for `o3-mini` with high reasoning effort.
  - `o4-mini-high` – alias for `o4-mini` with high reasoning effort.
- **Debug logging**
  - Set `LOG_LEVEL` to `debug` for in‑message log details. Can be set globally or per user.

### Tested models
All Responses API models should work. Confirmed with:
| Model ID | Status |
| --- | --- |
| chatgpt-4o-latest | ✅ |
| codex-mini-latest | ✅ |
| gpt-4.1 | ✅ |
| gpt-4o | ✅ |
| o3 | ✅ |

# How it Works / Design Architecture
## Core concepts
- **Responses API endpoint** – uses the advanced Responses API rather than completions, enabling features like native tool calling and reasoning traces.
- **Valves configuration** – each setting is exposed through valves, so you can tweak behavior without touching code.
- **History reconstruction** – previous tool calls are replayed when creating new requests, ensuring continuity.
- **Persistent tool results** – tool outputs are stored alongside messages, making them available on later turns.
- **Encrypted reasoning tokens** – specialized reasoning tokens (`encrypted_content`) are persisted to optimize follow‑ups.


## Persist OpenAI response items
Non-message items (function calls, encrypted reasoning tokens and so on) are stored under `openai_responses_pipe` within the chat record. Keeping these items allows the pipe to reconstruct the conversation state precisely, leading to better caching and faster responses.

This design matters for two main reasons:

1. **Improved caching and cost efficiency** – reconstructing the original context lets OpenAI grant cache-based pricing discounts (up to 75 %!).
2. **Faster replies** – reasoning tokens prevent the model from re-solving earlier steps, so responses are quicker.

You can inspect this data by opening **Developer Tools** and examining the POST request for a chat in the **Network** tab.

Full chat JSON structure example:

          "id": "<message_id>",
          "parentId": "<parent_message_id_or_null>",
          "childrenIds": ["<child_message_id>", "..."],
          "role": "user|assistant|function",
          "content": "<message_text_or_null>",
          "model": "<model_id>",
          "modelName": "<model_display_name>",

        }
      },
      "currentId": "<current_message_id>"
    },
    "messages": [
      {
        // Flattened version of messages
      }
    ],
    "tags": ["<optional_tag>", "..."],
    "timestamp": <unix_ms>,
    "files": [
      // Any attached files
    ],

    "openai_responses_pipe": {
      "__v": 2,
      "messages": {
        "<message_id>": {
          "model": "<model_that_generated_nonmessage_items>",
          "created_at": <unix_timestamp>,
          "items": [
            {
              "type": "function_call|function_call_result|reasoning|...",
              "...": "..."
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    // —————————————————
  },
  "updated_at": <unix_timestamp>,
  "created_at": <unix_timestamp>,
  "share_id": null,
  "archived": false,
  "pinned": false,
  "meta": {},
  "folder_id": null
}
```

Each item is tied to a specific `message_id` and the `model` that generated it. This ensures:

1. **Accurate Context Reconstruction**
   During replay or follow‑up turns, the pipe can precisely rebuild the state of the conversation, including tools or reasoning results not visible in plain messages.
2. **Model‑Specific Binding**
   Some items (especially **encrypted reasoning tokens!**) can only be used with the exact model that produced them. Injecting these into another model’s context may result in **errors** or degraded performance. Binding items to the generating model avoids this.

By storing raw `items` exactly as received from the API, the system remains forward‑compatible with future changes to the Responses API structure.
