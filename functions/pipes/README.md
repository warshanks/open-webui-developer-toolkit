Pipes are single Python files that implement a `Pipe` class with a `pipe()`
method.  Optionally they can expose multiple models by defining a
`pipes()` method that returns a list of model descriptors.  Each entry is a
dictionary with `id` and `name` keys and will appear as a separate model in
Open WebUI.

```
class Pipe:
    class Valves(BaseModel):
        MODEL_ID: str = "gpt-4o,gpt-4o-mini"

    def pipes(self):
        models = [m.strip() for m in self.valves.MODEL_ID.split(',') if m.strip()]
        return [{"id": m, "name": f"MyPipe: {m}"} for m in models]
```

When `MODEL_ID` contains multiple comma separated values the pipe becomes a
*manifold*, representing more than one model.

This repository's larger pipelines also include small helper functions for
building the request payload, streaming Server-Sent Events (SSE), and executing
tool calls.  See `openai_responses_api_pipeline.py` for async helpers such as
`prepare_payload`, `build_chat_history_for_responses_api`,
`stream_responses`, `get_responses`, `extract_response_text`, and
`execute_responses_tool_calls`.

Additional valves for injecting the current date and user context are documented
in `docs/instruction_injection_valves.md`.

For a deep dive into the structure of arguments supplied to `pipe()`, see
`docs/pipe_input.md`.
